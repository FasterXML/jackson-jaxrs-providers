/**
 * Basic implementation of JAX-RS abstractions ({@link MessageBodyReader},
 * {@link MessageBodyWriter}) needed for binding
 * Smile ("application/x-jackson-smile") content to and from Java Objects ("POJO"s).
 *<p>
 * Actual data binding functionality is implemented by {@link ObjectMapper}:
 * mapper to use can be configured in multiple ways:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>By explicitly passing mapper to use in constructor
 *  <li>By explictly setting mapper to use by {@link #setMapper}
 *  <li>By defining JAX-RS <code>Provider</code> that returns {@link ObjectMapper}s.
 *  <li>By doing none of above, in which case a default mapper instance is
 *     constructed (and configured if configuration methods are called)
 * </ul>
 * The last method ("do nothing specific") is often good enough; explicit passing
 * of Mapper is simple and explicit; and Provider-based method may make sense
 * with Depedency Injection frameworks, or if Mapper has to be configured differently
 * for different media types.
 *<p>
 * Note that the default mapper instance will be automatically created if
 * one of explicit configuration methods (like {@link #configure})
 * is called: if so, Provider-based introspection is <b>NOT</b> used, but the
 * resulting Mapper is used as configured.
 *<p>
 * Note that there is also a sub-class -- ({@link JacksonJaxbSmileProvider}) -- that
 * is configured by default to use both Jackson and JAXB annotations for configuration
 * (base class when used as-is defaults to using just Jackson annotations)
