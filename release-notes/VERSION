 (contributed by Steven S)

  'test'

#10: Problems with proxying of `ProviderBase` (add no-arg constructor)

2.2.0 (22-Apr-2013)

Changes:

#1: Allow binding input to `JsonParser`
#5: Add 'provider.removeUntouchable()'
* Add Woodstox dependency (not just in 'test' scope) to try to avoid problems
  with users relying on SJSXP (such as 'extra' xmlns declarations)
#8: Ensure that `JsonGenerator` is always properly closed, including error cases,
  otherwise can hide problems (due to missing flush of content)
 (contributed by Steven S)
